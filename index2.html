                    Products not meeting the criteria for “7-day Returns/Exchange ”.
            
                    Products that have been improperly used, including without limitation, having touched extremely damp objects,
                    chemicals,
                    gasoline, paint, detergent, solvent, or cooking oil, or having been overheated.
            
                    Products with loose threads or cracks due to external scratches by hard objects, or internal wear and tear.
            
                    Damaged products due to use for longer than service life.
            
                    Damaged products due to improper wash.
            
                    Products with color fading due to display.
            
                    Products with unclean appearance.

                    Customs Tariff
                    Sales tax is included in the final price but customers are still responsible for the duties if applicable.
            
                    KICKINGIT has no control over these charges as customs policies and import duties vary from country to country.
                    If the fees are applicable, they are not included in the transaction made and the person receiving the parcel
                    will be
                    billed directly by the courier in the designated country.
                    Please note that Sales tax and Customs Duties are non-refundable.
                    The buyer is encouraged to contact the local customs office for current charges prior to the purchase.
                    We are working to improve this service as soon as possible!

                    Risk and Fraud Control
                    KICKINGIT may ask for customer information when their payment info is involved with abnormal activities which
                    may be
                    related to scams or misuse of personal information. Please understand it is a process to protect the credit card
                    owner
                    and both sellers from frauds and scams. All of the information will only be used for identification purposes. If
                    customers refuse to provide the required information, we are always open to ordering cancellation. KICKINGIT
                    also has
                    the right to cancel any order without noticing the customer if we found the payment info is involved with
                    abnormal
                    activities.
            
                    Product information
                    While we have taken reasonable steps to depict Products as accurately as possible through the photographs and
                    other
                    images featured on the Site, the detailing (such as color, pattern, and texture, etc.) you see on-screen will
                    depend on
                    your monitor and, as such, may not exactly reflect the actual detailing of a Product when you receive it. Any
                    information on the Site regarding the sizing of Products is included as a guide only. If you are in any doubt as
                    to the
                    size of any Product you require, we recommend that you contact us prior to placing an order (see Contacting us).
            
                    Our liability
                    Except for any liability that, by law, may not be limited or excluded in no event shall we be liable to you for
                    any
                    losses and any liability we do have for losses you suffer arising from any order shall not exceed the purchase
                    price of
                    the relevant Product(s) and is strictly limited to losses that were reasonably foreseeable. Losses are
                    foreseeable where
                    they could be contemplated by you and us at the time your order is accepted by us. We will not be liable or
                    responsible
                    for any failure to perform or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under any order that is caused by
                    events
                    outside our reasonable control.
            
                    Termination
                    KICKINGIT reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your use of the Site and any rights provided
                    to you
